The script `avg_pixel.py` takes the average pixel color of images in the input and produces the result as a .png output.

I have been using this dataset [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html) when developing.

To make your own dataset, you can make use of the `find_faces.py -i <your-image>` file, which finds and saves all faces as black and white images in a .jpg or .png file to `assets/faces`.

### Example:
Below are the output images when comparing all women and men, respectively, from years 2000-2013 from the given dataset.
