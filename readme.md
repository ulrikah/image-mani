This script takes the average pixel color of images in the input and produces the result as a .png output.

TODO:
- write a set up guide
- parse command line args

pip-packages I've been using:

- imageio
- numpy
- pathlib
- face_recognition (which requires dlib)



I have been using this dataset [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html) when developing.

### Example:
Below are the output images when comparing all women and men, respectively, from years 2000-2013 from the given dataset.
